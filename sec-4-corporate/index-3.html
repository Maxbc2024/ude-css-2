            <p>
                This is Pamch Tutor. A tutoring genius who has been teaching ICT related courses since 2009. 
                I am a Masters Degree holder in Educational Technology. 
                I am dynamic, friendly, creative, flexible and interactive with my teaching profession. Teaching to me is not to pass time, it is what I breathe. I have experience in teaching HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, Microsoft office, Scratch animation, etc. Likewise, I train adults one-on-one on how to design websites, handbills, calendars, business cards using Corel Draw.
